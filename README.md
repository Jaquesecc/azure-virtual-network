A resource group in Azure is a container that organizes and manages related resources like virtual machines, storage, and applications.

When you go to Resource Groups, in the top left it will say "Create Resource Group" and this page will come up. Use your subscription you used to set up your Azure account, name your gruop, and then selectyour region.

After you set up your subscription, name, and region, click through review and create.

To make sure this is done correctly, go to the Azure homepage, go to Resource Groups, click the one that was just made, and you should see the Virtual Network is within the Resource Group.

For the demo, I will be using account name user123 and the password is Password1234.In real time, this username and password combination would not be an option, but is appropriate for the demo.

Click through to REview and Create and wait for the deployment to finish. once deployment is finished, go to Resource Groups and click on the one that we created for our network and machines. If done successfully, it will look like this, with everything needed for our virtual network and virtual machine contained in the same Resource Group:

This demonstration is now complete. This displayed how to configure a Virtual Network and Virtual Machines in Azure. We are able to add more machines to the network by following the same steps used above, and both VM's would be on the same Virtual Network!
